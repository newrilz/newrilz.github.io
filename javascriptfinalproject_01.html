<div class="class2">In the "post-truth" era, it is often difficult to consistently follow issues that are important to Americans. Some of the most difficult events to track are those surrounding the president, Donald Trump. This is why I created TrumpTracker, with the hope of creating a single website with the information needed to keep up to date on the activivities of the president, all in one place.</div>

<ul>
    <li class="class2"> I've decided to use 538's polling website as the main focus for approval ratings. While 538 does have a liberal slant, they do compile polls from many different sources and provide an accurate average.</li>

<ul>
    <li class="class2"> President Trump is a prolific tweeter, a habit that has often led him into media contreversy. I wanted to include his twitter feed as it is often his way of reaching out to his base.</li>

    <li class="class2"> Included below is a custom search engine which will only link to articles from what I believe to be reputable sources. In an attempt to avoid "fake news" and prevent a potential echo chamber, I have included sources from websites representing different political perspectives, while also trying to maintain reputablility. You may search whatever you would like, but my goal was to provide up-to-date reporting on the President, all centered in one place.</li>
